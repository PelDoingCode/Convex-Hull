## Convex-Hull

For my studies I have done a project on convex hull with Python 3.7.
I have implemented many methods to solve *convex hull* problem. <Enter>
  
 I also added my report where I studied all temporal complexity of my different methods, using a clear benchmark on different size and iteration problems. The aim was to point out that some methods are better depending the size of the hull or the number of points etc.
